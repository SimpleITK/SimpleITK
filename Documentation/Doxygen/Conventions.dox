/** \page Conventions Common Conventions for SimpleITK

This document contains common conventions that SimpleITK filters, and
objects follow. It is intended to describe the interfaces that users
should use and developers should implement. If a method or class does
not specify different behavior or default values then those described
here, it should be assumed that it follows the following conventions.

\section DimensionVectors Dimensional Vectors

Dimensional Vectors must contain at least the number of elements as
the dimensions of the image, elements beyond the image's dimension will
be truncated.

The SimpleITK image class can contain 2 or 3 dimensional images. In
ITK proper, certain types such as indexes, points, and sizes are
templeted over the image dimensions. In SimpleITK we utilize the
variable length std::vector for these types, so that non-templeted
calls can wrap ITK's templeted image class. These types are called 
Dimensional Vectors. If a dimensional vector's length is less that the
dimension of the image, an exception will be generated when converted
to the ITK type. If there are extra elements in the dimensional vector
these values will be ignored.

\section MaskDefaults Mask Image Types and Default Values

The default mask image type is a scalar image of sitkUInt8 or uint8_t
pixels. The default values are 0 and 1, with 1s representing the mask.

These defaults are for filter which create masks such as
thresholding, and certain other segmentation filters. Additionally, these
are the defaults for the binary morphology filters, so that they can
easily be applied after segmentation. This choice makes many mask
manipulations easier. For example, "masking" an image ( scalar or
vector ) is simply a matter of multiplying by a mask an
image. Additionally, the set of { 0, 1 } pixels is closed under the 
logical Boolean operators.

\section ProcedualParameters Order of Procedural Parameters

The order of the procedural parameters should be with the most
frequently modified parameters at the beginning of the parameter
list. While the last parameter, may be ones that the user does not
need to set or are infrequently used.


\section FollowITK Follow ITK Conventions

If not explicitly stated otherwise, then filter parameters are the
same default values as those in ITK proper.
