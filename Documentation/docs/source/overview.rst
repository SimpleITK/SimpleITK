Overview
========

SimpleITK is an image analysis toolkit with a large number of components
supporting general filtering operations, image segmentation and
registration. It is built on top of the Insight Segmentation and
Registration Toolkit `ITK`_ with the intent of providing a simplified
interface to ITK. SimpleITK itself is written in C++ but is available
for a large number of programming languages. Currently these include:

-  `Python`_
-  `R`_
-  `Java`_
-  `C#`_
-  `Lua`_
-  `TCL`_
-  `Ruby`_

Wrapping of the C++ code is accomplished through `SWIG`_, in principle,
any language wrapped by SWIG should be applicable to SimpleITK.

Unlike ITKâ€™s support of n-dimensional spatio-temporal images, SimpleITK
supports 2D, 3D and optionally 3D+time. The dimensionality refers to
spatio-temporal dimensions, the voxels can be n-dimensional vectors.
