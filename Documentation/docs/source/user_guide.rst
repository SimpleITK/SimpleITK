User Guide
**********

Here is a guide on SimpleITK.

You can download the source code/jupyter notebook for each of the guides
using the links at the bottom of the guide. However, to make code readable,
code for downloading and plotting the images has been extracted into
separate python files. You need to download them before running the guides.

.. Note::

    Please download the zipped files required to run the code below from 
    `here <_static/sitk_download_plot.zip>`_ and extract it to your 
    python environment (usually, directory in which you are running the code).
