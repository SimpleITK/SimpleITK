Welcome to SimpleITK 
=====================

SimpleITK is an image-analysis toolkit, providing a simplified programming interface to the algorithms and data structures of the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit. It supports image operations on 2D, 3D and 4D multi-channel images. The toolkit is available in eight programming languages including Python, R, Java, C#, C++, Lua, Ruby, and TCL.

The toolkit provides an extensive set of building blocks facilitating the construction of complex image 
analysis workflows without requiring significant expertise in software engineering. These workflows 
have advanced clinical care and enabled new discoveries in bio-medicine and various other fields 
requiring images analysis.

The SimpleITK community includes researchers from a variety of domains that require image analysis 
capabilities without requiring extensive expertise in software development. Originally the community 
consisted primarily of researchers from the biomedical sciences, though it has since expanded to many 
other disciplines. In the context of bio-medicine, the toolkit has been used in the analysis of anatomical 
structures imaged with CT, MR, and PET, and analysis of cellular structures imaged using dual photon 
microscopy, focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy and focal plane array microscopy. 
Outside of bio-medicine the toolkit has been used in a broad range of applications, from `identification 
of microplastics <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-018-1156-x>`_ in micro-Fourier 
transform infrared microscopy, to  
`analysis of fuel cells <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775316312381>`_ using  
X-ray tomography, and for `alignment of 
remote 
sensing images <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718304115>`_ acquired by 
unmanned aerial systems. 

Outside of the research setting, the toolkit is used in medical image analysis courses at multiple 
academic institutions, allowing 
students to focus more on the algorithms and less on learning complex software interfaces.

Binary distributions of SimpleITK are currently available for all three major operating systems
(Linux, OS X, and Windows). The code is copyrighted by the Insight Software Consortium and is
