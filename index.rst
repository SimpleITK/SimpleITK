This is a prototype of consolidated SimpleITK documentation in Sphinx
and is under development.

SimpleITK is a simplified, open source, interface to the National Library

open source image analysis toolkit which is widely used in academia and
industry. SimpleITK is available for eight programming languages including
C++, Python, R, Java, C#, Lua, Ruby, and TCL. Binary distributions of
SimpleITK are currently available for all three major operating systems
