History
=======

SimpleITK was created as part of a concerted effort to simplify the use of the Insight Toolkit, making it
more accessible to a wider audience.

The initial funding for the toolkit was provided by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM)
under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), with the initial version of the toolkit
developed as a collaboration between The Mayo Clinic, Kitware Inc, The University of Iowa and NLM's
intramural research program. The first major release of the toolkit was announced in April-May 2017.

Between 2013 and 2019, development was supported by the NLM intramural research
program with collaborators at The University of Iowa and Monash University.

Since 2019, SimpleITK development is supported by the Office of Cyber Infrastructure and
Computational Biology at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

The toolkit release history is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/SimpleITK/SimpleITK/releases>`_.
