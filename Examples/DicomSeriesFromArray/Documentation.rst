Dicom Series From Array
==============================

Overview
--------
This example illustrates how to write a DICOM series from a numeric array and create appropriate meta-data so it can be read my DICOM viewers.

Generating an array is done using a simple random number generator for this case but can come from other sources.

Writing the 3D image as a DICOM series is done by configuring the meta-data dictionary for each of the slices and then writing it in DICOM format. In our case we generate all of the meta-data to indicate that this series is derived. Note that we write the intensity values as is and thus do not set the rescale slope (0028|1053), rescale intercept (0028|1052) meta-data dictionary values.
