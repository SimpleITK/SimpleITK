Dicom Series Reader
==========================


Overview
--------

This example illustrates how to read a DICOM series into a 3D volume. Additional actions include printing some information, writing the image and possibly displaying it using the default display program via the SimpleITK `Show` function. The program makes several assumptions: the given directory contains at least one DICOM series, if there is more than one series the first series is read, and the default SimpleITK external viewer is installed.
