/** \class ImageFileReader
 * \brief Read an image file and return a SimpleITK Image.
 *
 * The reader can handle scalar images, and vector images. Pixel
 * types such as RGB, RGBA are loaded as multi-component
 * images with vector pixel types. Additionally, tensor images are
 * loaded with the pixel type being a 1-d vector.
 *
 * An interface is also provided to access the information from
 * the underlying itk::ImageIO. This information can be loaded
 * with the ReadImageInformation method. The information is from
 * the itk::ImageIO interface. In some degenerate cases reading
 * the bulk data may produce different results. Please see
 * itk::ImageFileReader for more details.
 *
 * Reading takes place by the ITK ImageIO factory mechanism. ITK
 * contains many ImageIO classes which are responsible for reading
 * separate file formats. By default, each ImageIO is asked if it
 * "can read" the file, and the first one which "can read" the
 * format is used. The list of available ImageIOs can be obtained
 * using the GetRegisteredImageIOs method. The ImageIO used can be
 * overridden with the SetImageIO method. This is useful in cases
 * when multiple ImageIOs "can read" the file and the user wants
 * to select a specific IO (not the first).
 *
 * \note DICOM tags are represented as strings in the meta-data
 * dictionary(s), therefore "0020|000D" and "0020|000d" are
 * different when accessing the tag value. This differs from
 * the hexadecimal numbers they represent, 0020|000D and 0020|000d
 * are equivalent. The ITK meta-data dictionary is string based
 * and uses lower case to represent the hexadecimal number read
 * from disk, so 0020|000d will work as a key and 0020|000D will
 * not be found in the dictionary (results in an exception if
 * attempting to access).
 * It is recommended to use lower case when setting and accessing
 * DICOM tags.
 *
 * \sa itk::simple::ReadImage for the procedural interface

   * file, an exception will be generated. If the size's length is
   * less than the image's dimension then the missing values are
   * assumed to be zero.

   * When the dimension of the image is reduced, the direction
   * cosine matrix will be set to the identity. However, the
