  "detaileddescription" : "\\par IMPORTANT\nThe SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter class and the ThresholdSegmentationLevelSetFunction class contain additional information necessary to the full understanding of how to use this filter.\n\n\\par OVERVIEW\nThis class is a level set method segmentation filter. It constructs a speed function which is close to zero at the upper and lower bounds of an intensity window, effectively locking the propagating front onto those edges. Elsewhere, the front will propagate quickly.\n\n\\par INPUTS\nThis filter requires two inputs. The first input is a seed image. This seed image must contain an isosurface that you want to use as the seed for your segmentation. It can be a binary, graylevel, or floating point image. The only requirement is that it contain a closed isosurface that you will identify as the seed by setting the IsosurfaceValue parameter of the filter. For a binary image you will want to set your isosurface value halfway between your on and off values (i.e. for 0's and 1's, use an isosurface value of 0.5).\n\n\\par \nThe second input is the feature image. This is the image from which the speed function will be calculated. For most applications, this is the image that you want to segment. The desired isosurface in your seed image should lie within the region of your feature image that you are trying to segment. Note that this filter does no preprocessing of the feature image before thresholding.\n\n\\par \nSee SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter for more information on Inputs.\n\n\\par OUTPUTS\nThe filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image. Positive values in the output image are inside the segmentated region and negative values in the image are outside of the inside region. The zero crossings of the image correspond to the position of the level set front.\n\n\\par \nSee SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilter and SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter for more information.\n\n\\par PARAMETERS\nIn addition to parameters described in SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter , this filter adds the UpperThreshold and LowerThreshold. See ThresholdSegmentationLevelSetFunction for a description of how these values affect the segmentation.\n\n\\see SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter \n\n\\see ThresholdSegmentationLevelSetFunction , \n\n\\see SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilter"
