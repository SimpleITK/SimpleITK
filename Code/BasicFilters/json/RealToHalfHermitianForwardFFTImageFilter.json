  "briefdescription" : "Base class for specialized real-to-complex forward Fast Fourier Transform.",
  "detaileddescription" : "This is a base class for the \"forward\" or \"direct\" discrete Fourier Transform. This is an abstract base class: the actual implementation is provided by the best child class available on the system when the object is created via the object factory system.\n\nThis class transforms a real input image into its complex Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a real input image has Hermitian symmetry:\\f$ f(\\mathbf{x}) = f^*(-\\mathbf{x}) \\f$ . That is, when the result of the transform is split in half along the X-dimension, the values in the second half of the transform are the complex conjugates of values in the first half reflected about the center of the image in each dimension. This filter takes advantage of the Hermitian symmetry property and reduces the size of the output in the first dimension to N/2+1, where N is the size of the input image in that dimension and the division by 2 is rounded down.\n\n\\see  HalfHermitianToRealInverseFFTImageFilter\n\\see \n\\see  ForwardFFTImageFilter"
