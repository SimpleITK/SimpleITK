briefdescription: Compute min, max, variance and mean of an Image .
detaileddescription: >-
  StatisticsImageFilter computes the minimum, maximum, sum, sum of squares, mean, variance sigma of an image. The filter needs
  all of its input image. It behaves as a filter with an input and output. Thus it can be inserted in a pipeline with other
  filters and the statistics will only be recomputed if a downstream filter changes.


  This filter is automatically multi-threaded and can stream its input when NumberOfStreamDivisions is set to more than one.
  Statistics are independently computed for each streamed and threaded region then merged.


  Internally a compensated summation algorithm is used for the accumulation of intensities to improve accuracy for large images.
