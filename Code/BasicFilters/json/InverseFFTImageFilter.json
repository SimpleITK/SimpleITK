This is an abstract base class: the actual implementation is provided by the best child available on the system when the object is created via the object factory system.\n\nThis class transforms a full complex image with Hermitian symmetry into its real spatial domain representation. If the input does not have Hermitian symmetry, the imaginary component is discarded.\n\n\\see ForwardFFTImageFilter , InverseFFTImageFilter",
