This class implements a denoising filter that uses iterative non-local, or semi-local, weighted averaging of image patches for image denoising. The intensity at each pixel 'p' gets updated as a weighted average of intensities of a chosen subset of pixels from the image.\nThis class implements the denoising algorithm using a Gaussian kernel function for nonparametric density estimation. The class implements a scheme to automatically estimated the kernel bandwidth parameter (namely, sigma) using leave-one-out cross validation. It implements schemes for random sampling of patches non-locally (from the entire image) as well as semi-locally (from the spatial proximity of the pixel being denoised at the specific point in time). It implements a specific scheme for defining patch weights (mask) as described in Awate and Whitaker 2005 IEEE CVPR and 2006 IEEE TPAMI.\n\\see  PatchBasedDenoisingBaseImageFilter\n\n"
