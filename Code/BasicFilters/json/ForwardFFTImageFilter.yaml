briefdescription: Base class for forward Fast Fourier Transform .
detaileddescription: >-
  This is a base class for the "forward" or "direct" discrete Fourier Transform . This is an abstract base class: the actual
  implementation is provided by the best child class available on the system when the object is created via the object factory
  system.


  This class transforms a real input image into its full complex Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a real input
  image has Hermitian symmetry: \f$ f(\mathbf{x}) = f^*(-\mathbf{x}) \f$ . That is, when the result of the transform is split
  in half along the x-dimension, the values in the second half of the transform are the complex conjugates of values in the
  first half reflected about the center of the image in each dimension.


  This filter works only for real single-component input image types.


  The output generated from a ForwardFFTImageFilter is in the dual space or frequency domain. Refer to FrequencyFFTLayoutImageRegionConstIteratorWithIndex
  for a description of the layout of frequencies generated after a forward FFT. Also see ITKImageFrequency for a set of filters
  requiring input images in the frequency domain.
