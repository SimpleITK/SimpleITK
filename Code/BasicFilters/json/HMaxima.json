This has the effect of smoothing over the \"high\" parts of the noise in the image without smoothing over large changes in intensity (region boundaries). See the HMinimaImageFilterto suppress the local minima whose depth is less than h intensity units below the (local) background.\nIf the output of HMaximaImageFilteris subtracted from the original image, the signicant \"peaks\" in the image can be identified. This is what the HConvexImageFilterprovides.\nThis filter uses the ReconstructionByDilationImageFilter. It provides its own input as the \"mask\" input to the geodesic dilation. The \"marker\" image for the geodesic dilation is the input image minus the height parameter h.\nGeodesic morphology and the H-Maxima algorithm is described in Chapter 6 of Pierre Soille's book \"Morphological ImageAnalysis: Principles and Applications\", Second Edition, Springer, 2003.\nThe height parameter is set using SetHeight.\n\\see  ReconstructionByDilationImageFilter, HMinimaImageFilter, HConvexImageFilter\n MorphologyImageFilter, GrayscaleDilateImageFilter, GrayscaleFunctionDilateImageFilter, BinaryDilateImageFilter\n\n\\li \n\n"
