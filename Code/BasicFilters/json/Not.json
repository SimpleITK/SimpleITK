  "detaileddescription": "This class is parametrized over the types of an input image and the type of the output image. Numeric conversions (castings) are done by the C++ defaults.\nSince the logical NOT operation is only defined in C++ for integer types, the images passed to this filter must comply with the requirement of using integer pixel type.\nThe total operation over one pixel will be\noutput_pixel = static_cast<OutputPixelType>( !input_pixel )\nWhere \"!\" is the unary NOT operator in C++.\n"
