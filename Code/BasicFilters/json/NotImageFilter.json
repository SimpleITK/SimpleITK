Numeric conversions (castings) are done by the C++ defaults.\n\nSince the logical NOT operation is operates only on boolean types, the input type must be implicitly convertible to bool, which is only defined in C++ for integer types, the images passed to this filter must comply with the requirement of using integer pixel type.\n\nThe total operation over one pixel will be\n\n\\code\n*  output_pixel = static_cast<OutputPixelType>( !input_pixel )\n* \n\\endcode\n\n\nWhere \"!\" is the unary Logical NOT operator in C++."
