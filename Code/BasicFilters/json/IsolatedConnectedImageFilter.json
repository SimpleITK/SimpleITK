  "detaileddescription" : "IsolatedConnectedImageFilter finds the optimal threshold to separate two regions. It has two modes, one to separate dark regions surrounded by bright regions by automatically finding a minimum isolating upper threshold, and another to separate bright regions surrounded by dark regions by automatically finding a maximum lower isolating threshold. The mode can be chosen by setting FindUpperThresholdOn() /Off(). In both cases, the isolating threshold is retrieved with GetIsolatedValue() .\n\nThe algorithm labels pixels with ReplaceValue that are connected to Seeds1 AND NOT connected to Seeds2. When finding the threshold to separate two dark regions surrounded by bright regions, given a fixed lower threshold, the filter adjusts the upper threshold until the two sets of seeds are not connected. The algorithm uses a binary search to adjust the upper threshold, starting at Upper. The reverse is true for finding the threshold to separate two bright regions. Lower defaults to the smallest possible value for the InputImagePixelType, and Upper defaults to the largest possible value for the InputImagePixelType.\n\nThe user can also supply the Lower and Upper values to restrict the search. However, if the range is too restrictive, it could happen that no isolating threshold can be found between the user specified Lower and Upper values. Therefore, unless the user is sure of the bounds to set, it is recommended that the user set these values to the lowest and highest intensity values in the image, respectively.\n\nThe user can specify more than one seed for both regions to separate. The algorithm will try find the threshold that ensures that all of the first seeds are contained in the resulting segmentation and all of the second seeds are not contained in the segmentation.\n\nIt is possible that the algorithm may not be able to find the isolating threshold because no such threshold exists. The user can check for this by querying the GetThresholdingFailed() flag."
