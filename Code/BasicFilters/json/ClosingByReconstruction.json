  "detaileddescription" : "This filter is similar to the morphological closing, but contrary to the mophological closing, the closing by reconstruction preserves the shape of the components. The closing by reconstruction of an image \"f\" is defined as:\nClosingByReconstruction(f) = ErosionByReconstruction(f, Dilation(f)).\nClosing by reconstruction not only preserves structures preserved by the dilation, but also levels raises the contrast of the darkest regions. If PreserveIntensities is on, a subsequent reconstruction by dilation using a marker image that is the original image for all unaffected pixels.\nClosing by reconstruction is described in Chapter 6.3.9 of Pierre Soille's book \"Morphological ImageAnalysis: Principles and Applications\", Second Edition, Springer, 2003.\n\\author Gaetan Lehmann.
