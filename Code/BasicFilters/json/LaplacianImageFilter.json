  "detaileddescription" : "This filter computes the Laplacian of a scalar-valued image. The Laplacian is an isotropic measure of the 2nd spatial derivative of an image. The Laplacian of an image highlights regions of rapid intensity change and is therefore often used for edge detection. Often, the Laplacian is applied to an image that has first been smoothed with a Gaussian filter in order to reduce its sensitivity to noise.\n\n\\par \nThe Laplacian at each pixel location is computed by convolution with the itk::LaplacianOperator .\n\n\\par Inputs and Outputs\nThe input to this filter is a scalar-valued itk::Image of arbitrary dimension. The output is a scalar-valued itk::Image .\n\n\\warning The pixel type of the input and output images must be of real type (float or double). ConceptChecking is used here to enforce the input pixel type. You will get a compilation error if the pixel type of the input and output images is not float or double.\n\n\\see Image \n\n\\see Neighborhood \n\n\\see NeighborhoodOperator \n\n\\see NeighborhoodIterator \n\n\\see LaplacianOperator \n\n\\par Wiki Examples:\n\n\\li All Examples \n\n\\li Compute the Laplacian of an image"
