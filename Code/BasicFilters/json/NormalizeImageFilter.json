This filter uses StatisticsImageFilter to compute the mean and variance of the input and then applies ShiftScaleImageFilter to shift and scale the pixels.\n\nNB: since this filter normalizes the data such that the mean is at 0, and \\f$-\\sigma\\f$ to \\f$+\\sigma\\f$ is mapped to -1.0 to 1.0, output image integral types will produce an image that DOES NOT HAVE a unit variance due to 68% of the intensity values being mapped to the real number range of -1.0 to 1.0 and then cast to the output integral value.\n\n\\see NormalizeToConstantImageFilter",
