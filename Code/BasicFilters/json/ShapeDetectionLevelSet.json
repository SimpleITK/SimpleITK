  "detaileddescription": "\\par IMPORTANT\nThe SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterclass and the ShapeDetectionLevelSetFunctionclass contain additional information necessary to gain full understanding of how to use this filter.\n\\par OVERVIEW\nThis class is a level set method segmentation filter. An initial contour is propagated outwards (or inwards) until it ''sticks'' to the shape boundaries. This is done by using a level set speed function based on a user supplied edge potential map. This approach for segmentation follows that of Malladi et al (1995).\n\\par INPUTS\nThis filter requires two inputs. The first input is a initial level set. The initial level set is a real image which contains the initial contour/surface as the zero level set. For example, a signed distance function from the initial contour/surface is typically used. Note that for this algorithm the initial contour has to be wholly within (or wholly outside) the structure to be segmented.\n\\par The second input is the feature image. For this filter, this is the edge potential map. General characteristics of an edge potential map is that it has values close to zero in regions near the edges and values close to one inside the shape itself. Typically, the edge potential map is compute from the image gradient, for example:\n \\f[ g(I) = 1 / ( 1 + | (\\nabla * G)(I)| ) \\f]   \\f[ g(I) = \\exp^{-|(\\nabla * G)(I)|} \\f]  \nwhere\\f$ I \\f$ is image intensity and\\f$ (\\nabla * G) \\f$ is the derivative of Gaussian operator.\n\\par See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterand SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilterfor more information on Inputs.\n\\par PARAMETERS\nThe PropagationScaling parameter can be used to switch from propagation outwards (POSITIVE scaling parameter) versus propagating inwards (NEGATIVE scaling parameter).\nThe smoothness of the resulting contour/surface can be adjusted using a combination of PropagationScaling and CurvatureScaling parameters. The larger the CurvatureScaling parameter, the smoother the resulting contour. The CurvatureScaling parameter should be non-negative for proper operation of this algorithm. To follow the implementation in Malladi et al paper, set the PropagtionScaling to\\f$\\pm 1.0\\f$ and CurvatureScaling to\\f$ \\epsilon \\f$ .\nNote that there is no advection term for this filter. Setting the advection scaling will have no effect.\n\\par OUTPUTS\nThe filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image. Negative values in the output image represent the inside of the segmentated region and positive values in the image represent the outside of the segmented region. The zero crossings of the image correspond to the position of the propagating front.\n\\par See SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilterand SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterfor more information.\n\\par REFERENCES\n\\par \"Shape Modeling with Front Propagation: A Level Set Approach\", R.
