  "detaileddescription": "\\par \nThis method is based on Topological Stable State Thresholding to calculate the threshold set point. This method is particularly effective when there are a large number of objects in a microscopy image. Compiling in Debug mode and enable the debug flag for this filter to print debug information to see how the filter focuses in on a threshold value. Please see the Insight Journal's MICCAI 2005 workshop for a complete description. References are below.\n\n\n\\par Parameters\nThe MinimumObjectSizeInPixels parameter is controlled through the class Get/SetMinimumObjectSizeInPixels() method. Similar to the standard itk::BinaryThresholdImageFilter the Get/SetInside and Get/SetOutside values of the threshold can be set. The GetNumberOfObjects() and GetThresholdValue() methods return the number of objects above the minimum pixel size and the calculated threshold value.\n\n\n\\par Automatic Thresholding in ITK\nThere are multiple methods to automatically calculate the threshold intensity value of an image. As of version 4.0, ITK has a Thresholding ( ITKThresholding ) module which contains numerous automatic thresholding methods.implements two of these. Topological Stable State Thresholding works well on images with a large number of objects to be counted.\n\n\n\\par References:\n1) Urish KL, August J, Huard J. \"Unsupervised segmentation for myofiber\ncounting in immunofluorescent microscopy images\".
