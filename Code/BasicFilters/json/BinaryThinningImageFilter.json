If the foreground pixels of the input image do not have a value of 1, they are rescaled to 1 internally to simplify the computation.\n\nThe filter will produce a skeleton of the object. The output background values are 0, and the foreground values are 1.\n\nThis filter is a sequential thinning algorithm and known to be computational time dependable on the image size. The algorithm corresponds with the 2D implementation described in:\n\nRafael C. Gonzales and Richard E. Woods. Digital ImageProcessing. Addison Wesley, 491-494, (1993).\n\nTo do: Make this filter ND.\n\n\\see  MorphologyImageFilter\n\\par Wiki Examples:\n\n\\li All Examples\n\n\\li Skeletonize/thin an image"
