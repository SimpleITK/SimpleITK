      "detaileddescriptionSet" : "Set/Get the flag for normalizing the gaussian over scale-space.\nThis flag enables the analysis of the differential shape of features independent of their size ( both pixels and physical size ). Following the notation of Tony Lindeberg:\nLet \\f[ L(x; t) = g(x; t) \\ast f(x) \\f]  be the scale-space representation of image \\f[ f(x) \\f]  where \\f[ g(x; t) = \\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{ 2 \\pi t} } \\exp{ \\left( -\\frac{x^2}{ 2 t } \\right) } \\f]  is the Gaussian function and \\f[\\ast\\f]  denotes convolution. This is a change from above with \\f[ t = \\sigma^2 \\f]  .\nThen the normalized derivative operator for normalized coordinates across scale is:\n \\f[ \\partial_\\xi = \\sqrt{t} \\partial_x \\f]  \nThe resulting scaling factor is \\f[ \\sigma^N \\f]  where N is the order of the derivative.\nWhen this flag is ON the filter will be normalized in such a way that the values of derivatives are not biased by the size of the object. That is to say the maximum value a feature reaches across scale is independent of the scale of the object.\nFor analyzing an image across scale-space you want to enable this flag. It is disabled by default.\n\\note Not all scale space axioms are satisfied by this filter, some are only approximated. Particularly, at fine scales ( say less than 1 pixel ) other methods such as a discrete Gaussian kernel should be considered.\n\n",

This class implements the recursive filtering method proposed by R.Deriche in IEEE-PAMI Vol.12, No.1, January 1990, pp 78-87, \"Fast Algorithms for Low-Level Vision\"\nDetails of the implementation are described in the technical report: R. Deriche, \"Recursively Implementing The Gaussian and Its Derivatives\", INRIA, 1993,ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/tech-reports/RR/RR-1893.ps.gz\nFurther improvements of the algorithm are described in: G. Farneback & C.-F. Westin, \"On Implementation of Recursive Gaussian\nFilters\", so far unpublished.\nAs compared to itk::DiscreteGaussianImageFilter, this filter tends to be faster for large kernels, and it can take the derivative of the blurred image in one step. Also, note that we have itk::RecursiveGaussianImageFilter::SetSigma(), but itk::DiscreteGaussianImageFilter::SetVariance().\n\\see  DiscreteGaussianImageFilter\n\\par Wiki Examples:\n\n\\li All Examples\n\\li Find higher derivatives of an image\n\n"
