  \par IMPORTANT

  The SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter class and the CannySegmentationLevelSetFunction class contain additional information
  necessary to the full understanding of how to use this filter.



  \par OVERVIEW

  This class is a level set method segmentation filter. It constructs a speed function which is designed to lock onto edges
  as detected by a Canny filter.



  \par

  The CannySegmentationLevelSetImageFilter can be a tool for refining an existing segmentation, or it can be used to try to
  segment a region by itself. Like all other level-set based segmentation filters (see SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter ),
  it works by first constructing a scalar speed term and a vector advection field based on edge features in the image. The
  level set front is then moved according to these two terms with the addition of a third curvature term to control the smoothness
  of the solution.



  \par

  The speed term is constructed as the Danielsson distance transform of the Canny edge image, as calculated by the CannyEdgeDetectionImageFilter
  . This scalar speed can be tuned in and out of the final evolution equation by setting the PropagationScaling parameter
  (a value of 0 removes the speed term).



  \par

  The advection field term is constructed by minimizing Danielsson distance squared. i.e. \f$ \mbox{min} \int D^2 \Rightarrow
  D \nabla D \f$ . This term moves the level set down the gradient of the distance transform.



  \par

  In practice, you may set the speed (propagation) term to zero if your initialization is already close to the edge you are
  interested in. If you are trying to segment a region by seeding with a small surface (blob, sphere) then you will likely
  want to add speed (propagation) to the equation so that the levelsets can expand along zero gradients. The relative influence
  of these two terms are controlled by the SetPropagationScaling and SetAdvectionScaling parameters.



  \par INPUTS

  This filter requires two inputs. The first input is a seed image. This seed image must contain an isosurface that you want
  to use as the seed for your segmentation. It can be a binary, graylevel, or floating point image. The only requirement is
  that it contain a closed isosurface that you will identify as the seed by setting the IsosurfaceValue parameter of the filter.
  For a binary image you will want to set your isosurface value halfway between your on and off values (i.e. for 0's and 1's,
  use an isosurface value of 0.5).



  \par

  The second input is the feature image. This is the image from which the speed function will be calculated. For most applications,
  this is the image that you want to segment. The desired isosurface in your seed image should lie within the region of your
  feature image that you are trying to segment.



  \par

  See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter for more information on Inputs.



  \par OUTPUTS

  The filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image. Positive *values in the output image are inside the segmented region
  and negative *values in the image are outside of the inside region. The zero crossings of *the image correspond to the position
  of the level set front.



  \par

  See SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilter and SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter for more information.



  \par PARAMETERS

  There are five parameters important for controlling the behavior of this filter.



  \par

  (1) Threshold. Sets the thresholding value of the Canny edge detection. See CannyEdgeDetectionImageFilter for more information.



  \par

  (2) Variance. Controls the smoothing parameter of the gaussian filtering done during Canny edge detection.



  \par

  (3) CurvatureScaling. Controls the degree to which curvature influences the evolution of the level set. Higher values relative
  to Propagation and Advection scalings will yield a smoother surface.



  \par

  (4) PropagationScaling. Scales the propagation (speed) term of the level set equation. Set this term to zero to allow the
  level set to flow only down the gradient of the distance transform.



  \par

  (5) AdvectionScaling. Scales influence of the advection field relative to curvature and propagation terms.
