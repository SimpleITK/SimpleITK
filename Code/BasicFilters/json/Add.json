  "detaileddescription": "This class is parametrized over the types of the two input images and the type of the output image. Numeric conversions (castings) are done by the C++ defaults.\nThe pixel type of the input 1 image must have a valid defintion of the operator+ with a pixel type of the image 2. This condition is required because internally this filter will perform the operation\npixel_from_image_1 + pixel_from_image_2\nAdditionally the type resulting from the sum, will be cast to the pixel type of the output image.\nThe total operation over one pixel will be\noutput_pixel = static_cast<OutputPixelType>( input1_pixel + input2_pixel )\nFor example, this filter could be used directly for adding images whose pixels are vectors of the same dimension, and to store the resulting vector in an output image of vector pixels.\nThe images to be added are set using the methods: SetInput1( image1 ); SetInput2( image2 );\n\\warning No numeric overflow checking is performed in this filter.\n\n\\li {ImageProcessing/AddImageFilter,Add two images together}\n\n"
