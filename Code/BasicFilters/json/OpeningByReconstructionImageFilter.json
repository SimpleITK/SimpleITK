  "detaileddescription" : "This filter preserves regions, in the foreground, that can completely contain the structuring element. At the same time, this filter eliminates all other regions of foreground pixels. Contrary to the mophological opening, the opening by reconstruction preserves the shape of the components that are not removed by erosion. The opening by reconstruction of an image \"f\" is defined as:\nOpeningByReconstruction(f) = DilationByRecontruction(f, Erosion(f)).\nOpening by reconstruction not only removes structures destroyed by the erosion, but also levels down the contrast of the brightest regions. If PreserveIntensities is on, a subsequent reconstruction by dilation using a marker image that is the original image for all unaffected pixels.\nOpening by reconstruction is described in Chapter 6.3.9 of Pierre Soille's book \"Morphological Image Analysis: Principles and\nApplications\", Second Edition, Springer, 2003.\n\\author Gaetan Lehmann.
