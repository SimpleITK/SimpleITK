  "detaileddescription" : "HausdorffDistanceImageFilter computes the distance between the set non-zero pixels of two images using the following formula: \\f[ H(A,B) = \\max(h(A,B),h(B,A)) \\f] where \\f[ h(A,B) = \\max_{a \\in A} \\min_{b \\in B} \\| a - b\\| \\f] is the directed Hausdorff distance and \\f$A\\f$ and \\f$B\\f$ are respectively the set of non-zero pixels in the first and second input images.\n\nIn particular, this filter uses the DirectedHausdorffImageFilter inside to compute the two directed distances and then select the largest of the two.\n\nThe Hausdorff distance measures the degree of mismatch between two sets and behaves like a metric over the set of all closed bounded sets - with properties of identity, symmetry and triangle inequality.\n\nThis filter requires the largest possible region of the first image and the same corresponding region in the second image. It behaves as filter with two inputs and one output. Thus it can be inserted in a pipeline with other filters. The filter passes the first input through unmodified.\n\nThis filter is templated over the two input image types. It assume both images have the same number of dimensions.\n\n\\see DirectedHausdorffDistanceImageFilter"
