  "detaileddescription": " HMinimaImageFiltersuppresses local minima that are less than h intensity units below the (local) background. This has the effect of smoothing over the \"low\" parts of the noise in the image without smoothing over large changes in intensity (region boundaries). See the HMaximaImageFilterto suppress the local maxima whose height is less than h intensity units above the (local) background.\nIf original image is subtracted from the output of HMinimaImageFilter, the signicant \"valleys\" in the image can be identified. This is what the HConcaveImageFilterprovides.\nThis filter uses the GrayscaleGeodesicErodeImageFilter. It provides its own input as the \"mask\" input to the geodesic dilation. The \"marker\" image for the geodesic dilation is the input image plus the height parameter h.\nGeodesic morphology and the H-Minima algorithm is described in Chapter 6 of Pierre Soille's book \"Morphological ImageAnalysis: Principles and Applications\", Second Edition, Springer, 2003.\n\\see GrayscaleGeodesicDilateImageFilter, HMinimaImageFilter, HConvexImageFilter\n\\see MorphologyImageFilter, GrayscaleDilateImageFilter, GrayscaleFunctionDilateImageFilter, BinaryDilateImageFilter\n\n\\li \n\n"
