The filter will produce as output the following images:\n\n\n\n\\li A Voronoi partition using the same numeric codes as the input. \n\n\n\\li A distance map with the approximation to the euclidean distance. from a particular pixel to the nearest object to this pixel in the input image. \n\n\n\\li A vector map containing the component of the vector relating the current pixel with the closest point of the closest object to this pixel. Given that the components of the distance are computed in \"pixels\", the vector is represented by an itk::Offset . That is, physical coordinates are not used.\n\n\n\nThis filter is N-dimensional and known to be efficient in computational time.
