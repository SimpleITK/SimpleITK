  "detaileddescription" : "This filter uses internally the VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter, and runs it iteratively until no pixels are being changed or until it reaches the maximum number of iterations. The purpose of the filter is to fill in holes of medium size (tens of pixels in radius). In principle the number of iterations is related to the size of the holes to be filled in. The larger the holes, the more iteration must be run with this filter in order to fill in the full hole. The size of the neighborhood is also related to the curvature of the hole borders and therefore the hole size. Note that as a collateral effect this filter may also fill in cavities in the external side of structures.\nThis filter is templated over a single image type because the output image type must be the same as the input image type. This is required in order to make the iterations possible, since the output image of one iteration is taken as the input image for the next iteration.\n\\see  Image\n\\see \n\\see  VotingBinaryImageFilter\n\\see \n\\see  VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter\n\\see \n\\see  Neighborhood\n\\see \n\\see  NeighborhoodOperator\n\\see \n\\see  NeighborhoodIterator\n\n"
