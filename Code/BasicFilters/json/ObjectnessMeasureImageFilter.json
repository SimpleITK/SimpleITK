  "briefdescription": "Enhance M-dimensional objects in N-dimensional images.",
  "detaileddescription": "This filter is a generalization of Frangi's vesselness measurement for detecting M-dimensional object in N-dimensional space. For example a vessel is a 1-D object in 3-D space. The filter can enhance blob-like structures (M=0), vessel-like structures (M=1), 2D plate-like structures (M=2), hyper-plate-like structures (M=3) in N-dimensional images, with M<N.\n\nThis filter takes a scalar image as input and produces a real valued image as output which contains the objectness measure at each pixel. Internally, it computes a Hessian via discrete central differences. Before applying this filter it is expected that a Gaussian smoothing filter at an appropriate scale (sigma) was applied to the input image.\n\nThe enhancement is based on the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. For the Frangi's vesselness case were M=1 and N=3 we have the 3 eigenvalues such that \\f$ | \\lambda_1 | < | \\lambda_2 | < |\\lambda_3 | \\f$ . The formula follows:\n\n \\f[ R_A = \\frac{|\\lambda_2|}{|\\lambda_3|}, \\; R_B = \\frac{|\\lambda_2|}{|\\lambda_2\\lambda_3|}, \\; S = \\sqrt{\\lambda_1^2+\\lambda_2^2+\\lambda_3^2} \\f] \\f[ V_{\\sigma}= \\begin{cases} (1-e^{-\\frac{R_A^2}{2\\alpha^2}}) \\cdot e^{\\frac{R_B^2}{2\\beta^2}} \\cdot (1-e^{-\\frac{S^2}{2\\gamma^2}}) & \\text{if } \\lambda_2<0 \\text{ and } \\lambda_3<0 \\text{,}\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\f] \n\n\\par References\nAntiga, L.
