briefdescription: Label the objects in a binary image.
detaileddescription: >-
  ConnectedComponentImageFilter labels the objects in a binary image (non-zero pixels are considered to be objects, zero-valued
  pixels are considered to be background). Each distinct object is assigned a unique label. The filter experiments with some
  improvements to the existing implementation, and is based on run length encoding along raster lines. If the output background
  value is set to zero (the default), the final object labels start with 1 and are consecutive. If the output background is
  set to a non-zero value (by calling the SetBackgroundValue() routine of the filter), the final labels start at 0, and remain
  consecutive except for skipping the background value as needed. Objects that are reached earlier by a raster order scan
  have a lower label. This is different to the behaviour of the original connected component image filter which did not produce
  consecutive labels or impose any particular ordering.


  After the filter is executed, ObjectCount holds the number of connected components.
