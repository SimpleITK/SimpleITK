The filter experiments with some improvements to the existing implementation, and is based on run length encoding along raster lines. The final object labels start with 1 and are consecutive. Objects that are reached earlier by a raster order scan have a lower label. This is different to the behaviour of the original connected component image filter which did not produce consecutive labels or impose any particular ordering.\n\\see  ImageToImageFilter\n\\par Wiki Examples:\n\n\\li All Examples\n\n\\li Label connected components in a binary image\n\n"
