Numeric conversions (castings) are done by the C++ defaults.\nThe pixel type of the input 2 image must have a valid defintion of the operator != with zero. This condition is required because internally this filter will perform the operation\nif pixel_from_mask_image != 0 pixel_output_image = output_value else pixel_output_image = pixel_input_image\nThe pixel from the input 1 is cast to the pixel type of the output image.\nNote that the input and the mask images must be of the same size.\n\\warning Any pixel value other than 0 will not be masked out.\n\\see MaskImageFilter\n\n"
