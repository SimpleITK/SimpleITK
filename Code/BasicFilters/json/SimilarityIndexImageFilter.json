  "detaileddescription" : "SimilarityIndexImageFilter measures the similarity between the set non-zero pixels of two images using the following formula: \\f[ S = \\frac{2 | A \\cap B |}{|A| + |B|} \\f] where \\f$A\\f$ and \\f$B\\f$ are respectively the set of non-zero pixels in the first and second input images. Operator \\f$|\\cdot|\\f$ represents the size of a set and \\f$\\cap\\f$ represents the intersection of two sets.\n\nThe measure is derived from a reliability measure known as the kappa statistic. \\f$S\\f$ is sensitive to both differences in size and in location and have been in the literature for comparing two segmentation masks. For more information see: \"Morphometric Analysis of White Matter Lesions in MR Images: Method and\nValidation\", A. P. Zijdenbos, B. M. Dawant, R. A. Margolin and A. C. Palmer, IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging, 13(4) pp 716-724,1994\n\nThis filter requires the largest possible region of the first image and the same corresponding region in the second image. It behaves as filter with two input and one output. Thus it can be inserted in a pipeline with other filters. The filter passes the first input through unmodified.\n\nThis filter is templated over the two input image type. It assume both image have the same number of dimensions.",
