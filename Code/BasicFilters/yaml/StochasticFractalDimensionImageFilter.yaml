  The methodology is based on Mandelbrot's fractal theory and the concept of fractional Brownian motion and yields images
  which have been used for classification and edge enhancement.


  This class which is templated over the input and output images as well as a mask image type. The input is a scalar image,
  an optional neighborhood radius (default = 2), and an optional mask. The mask can be specified to decrease computation time
  since, as the authors point out, calculation is time-consuming.
