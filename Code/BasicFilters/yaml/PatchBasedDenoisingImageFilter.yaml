briefdescription: Derived class implementing a specific patch-based denoising algorithm, as detailed below.
detaileddescription: >-
  This class is derived from the base class PatchBasedDenoisingBaseImageFilter ; please refer to the documentation of the
  base class first. This class implements a denoising filter that uses iterative non-local, or semi-local, weighted averaging
  of image patches for image denoising. The intensity at each pixel 'p' gets updated as a weighted average of intensities
  of a chosen subset of pixels from the image.


  This class implements the denoising algorithm using a Gaussian kernel function for nonparametric density estimation. The
  class implements a scheme to automatically estimated the kernel bandwidth parameter (namely, sigma) using leave-one-out
  cross validation. It implements schemes for random sampling of patches non-locally (from the entire image) as well as semi-locally
  (from the spatial proximity of the pixel being denoised at the specific point in time). It implements a specific scheme
  for defining patch weights (mask) as described in Awate and Whitaker 2005 IEEE CVPR and 2006 IEEE TPAMI.
