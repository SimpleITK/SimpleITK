briefdescription: Normalize an image by setting its mean to zero and variance to one.
detaileddescription: >-
  NormalizeImageFilter shifts and scales an image so that the pixels in the image have a zero mean and unit variance. This
  filter uses StatisticsImageFilter to compute the mean and variance of the input and then applies ShiftScaleImageFilter to
  shift and scale the pixels.


  NB: since this filter normalizes the data such that the mean is at 0, and \f$-\sigma\f$ to \f$+\sigma\f$ is mapped to -1.0
  to 1.0, output image integral types will produce an image that DOES NOT HAVE a unit variance due to 68% of the intensity
  values being mapped to the real number range of -1.0 to 1.0 and then cast to the output integral value.
