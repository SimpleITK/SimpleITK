    Majority threshold. It is the number of pixels over 50% that will decide whether an OFF pixel will become ON or not. For
    example, if the neighborhood of a pixel has 124 pixels (excluding itself), the 50% will be 62, and if you set up a Majority
    threshold of 5, that means that the filter will require 67 or more neighbor pixels to be ON in order to switch the current
    OFF pixel to ON. The default value is 1.

briefdescription: Fills in holes and cavities by iteratively applying a voting operation.
detaileddescription: >-
  This filter uses internally the VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter , and runs it iteratively until no pixels are being changed
  or until it reaches the maximum number of iterations. The purpose of the filter is to fill in holes of medium size (tens
  of pixels in radius). In principle the number of iterations is related to the size of the holes to be filled in. The larger
  the holes, the more iteration must be run with this filter in order to fill in the full hole. The size of the neighborhood
  is also related to the curvature of the hole borders and therefore the hole size. Note that as a collateral effect this
  filter may also fill in cavities in the external side of structures.


  This filter is templated over a single image type because the output image type must be the same as the input image type.
  This is required in order to make the iterations possible, since the output image of one iteration is taken as the input
  image for the next iteration.
