  type: uint64_t

  briefdescriptionSet: ''
  detaileddescriptionSet: >-
    Set the minimum size in pixels for an object. All objects smaller than this size will be discarded and will not appear
    in the output label map. NumberOfObjects will count only the objects whose pixel counts are greater than or equal to the
    minimum size. Call GetOriginalNumberOfObjects to find out how many objects were present in the original label map.
  briefdescriptionGet: ''
  detaileddescriptionGet: >-
    Get the caller-defined minimum size of an object in pixels. If the caller has not set the minimum, 0 will be returned,
    which is to be interpreted as meaning that no minimum exists, and all objects in the original label map will be passed
    through to the output.
- name: SortByObjectSize
  type: bool
  default: 'true'
  briefdescriptionSet: ''
  detaileddescriptionSet: >-
    Controls whether the object labels are sorted by size. If false, initial order of labels is kept.

  detaileddescriptionGet: >-
    Get the original number of objects in the image before small objects were discarded. This information is only valid after

briefdescription: Relabel the components in an image such that consecutive labels are used.
detaileddescription: >-
  RelabelComponentImageFilter remaps the labels associated with the objects in an image (as from the output of ConnectedComponentImageFilter
  ) such that the label numbers are consecutive with no gaps between the label numbers used. By default, the relabeling will
  also sort the labels based on the size of the object: the largest object will have label #1, the second largest will have
  label #2, etc. If two labels have the same size their initial order is kept. The sorting by size can be disabled using SetSortByObjectSize.


  Label #0 is assumed to be the background and is left unaltered by the relabeling.


  RelabelComponentImageFilter is typically used on the output of the ConnectedComponentImageFilter for those applications
  that want to extract the largest object or the "k" largest objects. Any particular object can be extracted from the relabeled
  output using a BinaryThresholdImageFilter . A group of objects can be extracted from the relabeled output using a ThresholdImageFilter
  .


  Once all the objects are relabeled, the application can query the number of objects and the size of each object. Object
  sizes are returned in a vector. The size of the background is not calculated. So the size of object #1 is GetSizeOfObjectsInPixels()
  [0], the size of object #2 is GetSizeOfObjectsInPixels() [1], etc.


  If user sets a minimum object size, all objects with fewer pixels than the minimum will be discarded, so that the number
  of objects reported will be only those remaining. The GetOriginalNumberOfObjects method can be called to find out how many
  objects were present before the small ones were discarded.


  RelabelComponentImageFilter can be run as an "in place" filter, where it will overwrite its output. The default is run out
  of place (or generate a separate output). "In place" operation can be controlled via methods in the superclass, InPlaceImageFilter::InPlaceOn()
  and InPlaceImageFilter::InPlaceOff().
