  Limitations: Spline order must be between 0 and 5. Spline order must be set before setting the image. Uses mirror boundary
  conditions. Requires the same order of Spline for each dimension. Can only process LargestPossibleRegion

briefdescription: Calculates the B-Spline coefficients of an image. Spline order may be from 0 to 5.
