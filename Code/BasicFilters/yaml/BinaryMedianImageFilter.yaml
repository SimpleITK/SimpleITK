briefdescription: Applies a version of the median filter optimized for binary images.
detaileddescription: >-
  This filter was contributed by Bjorn Hanch Sollie after identifying that the generic Median filter performed unnecessary
  operations when the input image is binary.


  This filter computes an image where a given pixel is the median value of the pixels in a neighborhood about the corresponding
  input pixel. For the case of binary images the median can be obtained by simply counting the neighbors that are foreground.


  A median filter is one of the family of nonlinear filters. It is used to smooth an image without being biased by outliers
  or shot noise.
