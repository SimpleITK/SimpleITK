    After grid based initialization, this option enables moving the initial cluster center location to the minimum gradient
    in a small neighborhood. If the grid size is less than three this is automatically disabled.

    After each iteration the residual is computed as the distance between the current clusters and the previous. This is averaged
    so that the value is independent of the number of clusters.

  The Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm groups pixels into a set of labeled regions or super-pixels. Super-pixels
  follow natural image boundaries, are compact, and are nearly uniform regions which can be used as a larger primitive for
  more efficient computation. The SLIC algorithm can be viewed as a spatially constrained iterative k-means method.


  The original algorithm was designed to cluster on the joint domain of the images index space and its CIELAB color space.
  This implementation works with images of arbitrary dimension as well as scalar, single channel, images and most multi-component
  image types including ITK's arbitrary length VectorImage .


  The distance between a pixel and a cluster is the sum of squares of the difference between their joint range and domains
  ( index and value ). The computation is done in index space with scales provided by the SpatialProximityWeight parameters.


  The output is a label image with each label representing a superpixel cluster. Every pixel in the output is labeled, and
  the starting label id is zero.
