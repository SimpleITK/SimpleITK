  \par IMPORTANT

  The SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter class and the ShapeDetectionLevelSetFunction class contain additional information necessary
  to gain full understanding of how to use this filter.



  \par OVERVIEW

  This class is a level set method segmentation filter. An initial contour is propagated outwards (or inwards) until it ''sticks''
  to the shape boundaries. This is done by using a level set speed function based on a user supplied edge potential map. This
  approach for segmentation follows that of Malladi et al (1995).



  \par INPUTS

  This filter requires two inputs. The first input is a initial level set. The initial level set is a real image which contains
  the initial contour/surface as the zero level set. For example, a signed distance function from the initial contour/surface
  is typically used. Note that for this algorithm the initial contour has to be wholly within (or wholly outside) the structure
  to be segmented.



  \par

  The second input is the feature image. For this filter, this is the edge potential map. General characteristics of an edge
  potential map is that it has values close to zero in regions near the edges and values close to one inside the shape itself.
  Typically, the edge potential map is compute from the image gradient, for example:


   \f[ g(I) = 1 / ( 1 + | (\nabla * G)(I)| ) \f] \f[ g(I) = \exp^{-|(\nabla * G)(I)|} \f]

  where \f$ I \f$ is image intensity and \f$ (\nabla * G) \f$ is the derivative of Gaussian operator.


  \par

  See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter and SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilter for more information on Inputs.



  \par PARAMETERS

  The PropagationScaling parameter can be used to switch from propagation outwards (POSITIVE scaling parameter) versus propagating
  inwards (NEGATIVE scaling parameter).



  The smoothness of the resulting contour/surface can be adjusted using a combination of PropagationScaling and CurvatureScaling
  parameters. The larger the CurvatureScaling parameter, the smoother the resulting contour. The CurvatureScaling parameter
  should be non-negative for proper operation of this algorithm. To follow the implementation in Malladi et al paper, set
  the PropagationScaling to \f$\pm 1.0\f$ and CurvatureScaling to \f$ \epsilon \f$ .


  Note that there is no advection term for this filter. Setting the advection scaling will have no effect.


  \par OUTPUTS

  The filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image. Negative values in the output image represent the inside of the
  segmented region and positive values in the image represent the outside of the segmented region. The zero crossings of the
  image correspond to the position of the propagating front.
