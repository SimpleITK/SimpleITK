briefdescription: This filter computes one-pixel-wide edges of the input image.
detaileddescription: >-
  This class is parameterized over the type of the input image and the type of the output image.


  The input is assumed to be a binary image. If the foreground pixels of the input image do not have a value of 1, they are
  rescaled to 1 internally to simplify the computation.


  The filter will produce a skeleton of the object. The output background values are 0, and the foreground values are 1.


  This filter is a sequential thinning algorithm and known to be computational time dependable on the image size. The algorithm
  corresponds with the 2D implementation described in:


  Rafael C. Gonzales and Richard E. Woods. Digital Image Processing. Addison Wesley, 491-494, (1993).


  To do: Make this filter ND.
