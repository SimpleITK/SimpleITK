    Set/Get whether or not the filter will use the spacing of the input image in its calculations. Use On to take the image
    spacing information into account and to compute the derivatives in physical space; use Off to ignore the image spacing
    and to compute the derivatives in isotropic voxel space. Default is On.

    The UseImageDirection flag determines whether image derivatives are computed with respect to the image grid or with respect
    to the physical space. When this flag is ON the derivatives are computed with respect to the coordinate system of physical
    space. The difference is whether we take into account the image Direction or not. The flag ON will take into account the
    image direction and will result in an extra matrix multiplication compared to the amount of computation performed when
    the flag is OFF. The default value of this flag is On.

briefdescription: Computes the gradient of an image using directional derivatives.
detaileddescription: >-
  Computes the gradient of an image using directional derivatives. The directional derivative at each pixel location is computed
  by convolution with a first-order derivative operator.


  The second template parameter defines the value type used in the derivative operator (defaults to float). The third template
  parameter defines the value type used for output image (defaults to float). The output image is defined as a covariant vector
  image whose value type is specified as this third template parameter.
