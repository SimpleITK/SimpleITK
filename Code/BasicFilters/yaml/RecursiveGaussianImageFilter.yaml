    Set/Get the flag for normalizing the gaussian over scale-space.


    This flag enables the analysis of the differential shape of features independent of their size ( both pixels and physical
    size ). Following the notation of Tony Lindeberg:


    Let \f[ L(x; t) = g(x; t) \ast f(x) \f] be the scale-space representation of image \f[ f(x) \f] where \f[ g(x; t) = \frac{1}{
    \sqrt{ 2 \pi t} } \exp{ \left( -\frac{x^2}{ 2 t } \right) } \f] is the Gaussian function and \f[\ast\f] denotes convolution.
    This is a change from above with \f[ t = \sigma^2 \f] .


    Then the normalized derivative operator for normalized coordinates across scale is:

     \f[ \partial_\xi = \sqrt{t} \partial_x \f]

    The resulting scaling factor is \f[ \sigma^N \f] where N is the order of the derivative.


    When this flag is ON the filter will be normalized in such a way that the values of derivatives are not biased by the
    size of the object. That is to say the maximum value a feature reaches across scale is independent of the scale of the
    object.


    For analyzing an image across scale-space you want to enable this flag. It is disabled by default.


    \note Not all scale space axioms are satisfied by this filter, some are only approximated. Particularly, at fine scales
    ( say less than 1 pixel ) other methods such as a discrete Gaussian kernel should be considered.

briefdescription: Base class for computing IIR convolution with an approximation of a Gaussian kernel.
detaileddescription: "\\f[ \\frac{ 1 }{ \\sigma \\sqrt{ 2 \\pi } } \\exp{ \\left( - \\frac{x^2}{ 2 \\sigma^2 } \\right) }\
  \ \\f]\n\nRecursiveGaussianImageFilter is the base class for recursive filters that approximate convolution with the Gaussian\
  \ kernel. This class implements the recursive filtering method proposed by R.Deriche in IEEE-PAMI Vol.12, No.1, January\
  \ 1990, pp 78-87, \"Fast Algorithms for Low-Level Vision\"\n\nDetails of the implementation are described in the technical\
  \ report: R. Deriche, \"Recursively Implementing The Gaussian and Its Derivatives\", INRIA, 1993, ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/tech-reports/RR/RR-1893.ps.gz\n\
  \nFurther improvements of the algorithm are described in: G. Farneb\xE4ck & C.-F. Westin, \"Improving Deriche-style Recursive\
  \ Gaussian\nFilters\". J Math Imaging Vis 26, 293\u2013299 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-006-8464-z\n\nAs compared\
  \ to itk::DiscreteGaussianImageFilter , this filter tends to be faster for large kernels, and it can take the derivative\
  \ of the blurred image in one step. Also, note that we have itk::RecursiveGaussianImageFilter::SetSigma() , but itk::DiscreteGaussianImageFilter::SetVariance()\
