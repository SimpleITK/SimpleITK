briefdescription: Reinitialize the level set to the signed distance function.
detaileddescription: >-
  ReinitializeLevelSetImageFilter reinitializes the input level set to the approximated signed distance function from a particular
  level set. The output is a level set of the same type as the input.


  For some level set algorithms, it is useful to periodically reinitialize the level set function to prevent numerical accuracy
  problems in computing derivatives and curvature values where level sets are densely bunched together.


  This class is templated over the image type which represents the level set.


  This class supports narrowbanding. If the input narrowband is provided, the algorithm will only locate the level set within
  the input narrowband. For the output, the reinitialize level set is only valid for a distance of OutputNarrowBandwidth /
  2 of either side of the level set of interest.


  Implementation of this class is based on Chapter 11 of "Level Set Methods and Fast Marching Methods", J.A. Sethian, Cambridge
  Press, Second edition, 1999.
