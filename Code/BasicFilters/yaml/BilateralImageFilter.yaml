briefdescription: Blurs an image while preserving edges.
detaileddescription: >-
  This filter uses bilateral filtering to blur an image using both domain and range "neighborhoods". Pixels that are close
  to a pixel in the image domain and similar to a pixel in the image range are used to calculate the filtered value. Two gaussian
  kernels (one in the image domain and one in the image range) are used to smooth the image. The result is an image that is
  smoothed in homogeneous regions yet has edges preserved. The result is similar to anisotropic diffusion but the implementation
  in non-iterative. Another benefit to bilateral filtering is that any distance metric can be used for kernel smoothing the
  image range. Hence, color images can be smoothed as vector images, using the CIE distances between intensity values as the
  similarity metric (the Gaussian kernel for the image domain is evaluated using CIE distances). A separate version of this
  filter will be designed for color and vector images.


  Bilateral filtering is capable of reducing the noise in an image by an order of magnitude while maintaining edges.


  The bilateral operator used here was described by Tomasi and Manduchi (Bilateral Filtering for Gray and ColorImages. IEEE
  ICCV. 1998.)
