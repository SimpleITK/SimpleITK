briefdescription: Transforms the image so that any pixel that is not a regional minima is set to the maximum value for the
  pixel type. Pixels that are regional minima retain their value.

  Regional minima are flat zones surrounded by pixels of higher value. A completely flat image will be marked as a regional
  minima by this filter.
