briefdescription: Geodesic grayscale dilation of an image.
detaileddescription: >-
  Geodesic dilation operates on a "marker" image and a "mask" image. The marker image is dilated using an elementary structuring
  element (neighborhood of radius one using only the face connected neighbors). The resulting image is then compared with
  the mask image. The output image is the pixelwise minimum of the dilated marker image and the mask image.


  Geodesic dilation is run either one iteration or until convergence. In the convergence case, the filter is equivalent to
  "reconstruction by dilation". This filter is implemented to handle both scenarios. The one iteration case is multi-threaded.
  The convergence case is delegated to another instance of the same filter (but configured to run a single iteration).


  The marker image must be less than or equal to the mask image (on a pixel by pixel basis).


  Geodesic morphology is described in Chapter 6 of Pierre Soille's book "Morphological Image Analysis: Principles and Applications",
  Second Edition, Springer, 2003.


  A noniterative version of this algorithm can be found in the ReconstructionByDilationImageFilter . This noniterative solution
  is much faster than the implementation provided here. All ITK filters that previously used GrayscaleGeodesicDilateImageFilter
  as part of their implementation have been converted to use the ReconstructionByDilationImageFilter . The GrayscaleGeodesicDilateImageFilter
  is maintained for backward compatibility.
