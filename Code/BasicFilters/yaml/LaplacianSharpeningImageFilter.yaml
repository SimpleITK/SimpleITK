briefdescription: This filter sharpens an image using a Laplacian. LaplacianSharpening highlights regions of rapid intensity
  change and therefore highlights or enhances the edges. The result is an image that appears more in focus.
detaileddescription: >-
  \par The LaplacianSharpening at each pixel location is computed by

  convolution with the itk::LaplacianOperator .



  \par Inputs and Outputs

  The input to this filter is a scalar-valued itk::Image of arbitrary dimension. The output is a scalar-valued itk::Image
  .
