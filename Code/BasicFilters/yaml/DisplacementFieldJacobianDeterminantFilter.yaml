briefdescription: 'Computes a scalar image from a vector image (e.g., deformation field) input, where each output scalar at
  each pixel is the Jacobian determinant of the vector field at that location. This calculation is correct in the case where
  the vector image is a "displacement" from the current location. The computation for the jacobian determinant is: det[ dT/dx
  ] = det[ I + du/dx ].'

  \par Overview

  This filter is based on itkVectorGradientMagnitudeImageFilter and supports the m_DerivativeWeights weights for partial derivatives.



  Note that the determinant of a zero vector field is also zero, whereas the Jacobian determinant of the corresponding identity
  warp transformation is 1.0. In order to compute the effective deformation Jacobian determinant 1.0 must be added to the
  diagonal elements of Jacobian prior to taking the derivative. i.e. det([ (1.0+dx/dx) dx/dy dx/dz ; dy/dx (1.0+dy/dy) dy/dz;
  dz/dx dz/dy (1.0+dz/dz) ])


  \par Template Parameters (Input and Output)

  This filter has one required template parameter which defines the input image type. The pixel type of the input image is
  assumed to be a vector (e.g., itk::Vector , itk::RGBPixel , itk::FixedArray ). The scalar type of the vector components
  must be castable to floating point. Instantiating with an image of RGBPixel<unsigned short>, for example, is allowed, but
  the filter will convert it to an image of Vector<float,3> for processing.



  The second template parameter, TRealType, can be optionally specified to define the scalar numerical type used in calculations.
  This is the component type of the output image, which will be of itk::Vector<TRealType, N>, where N is the number of channels
  in the multiple component input image. The default type of TRealType is float. For extra precision, you may safely change
  this parameter to double.


  The third template parameter is the output image type. The third parameter will be automatically constructed from the first
  and second parameters, so it is not necessary (or advisable) to set this parameter explicitly. Given an M-channel input
  image with dimensionality N, and a numerical type specified as TRealType, the output image will be of type itk::Image<TRealType,
  N>.


  \par Filter Parameters

  The method UseImageSpacingOn will cause derivatives in the image to be scaled (inversely) with the pixel size of the input
  image, effectively taking derivatives in world coordinates (versus isotropic image space). UseImageSpacingOff turns this
  functionality off. Default is UseImageSpacingOn. The parameter UseImageSpacing can be set directly with the method SetUseImageSpacing(bool)
  .



  Weights can be applied to the derivatives directly using the SetDerivativeWeights method. Note that if UseImageSpacing is
  set to TRUE (ON), then these weights will be overridden by weights derived from the image spacing when the filter is updated.
  The argument to this method is a C array of TRealValue type.


  \par Constraints

  We use vnl_det for determinant computation, which only supports square matrices. So the vector dimension of the input image
  values must be equal to the image dimensions, which is trivially true for a deformation field that maps an n-dimensional
  space onto itself.



  Currently, dimensions up to and including 4 are supported. This limitation comes from the presence of vnl_det() functions
  for matrices of dimension up to 4x4.


  The template parameter TRealType must be floating point (float or double) or a user-defined "real" numerical type with arithmetic
  operations defined sufficient to compute derivatives.
