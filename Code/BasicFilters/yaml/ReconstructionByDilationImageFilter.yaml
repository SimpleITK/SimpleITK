briefdescription: grayscale reconstruction by dilation of an image
detaileddescription: >-
  Reconstruction by dilation operates on a "marker" image and a "mask" image, and is defined as the dilation of the marker
  image with respect to the mask image iterated until stability.


  The marker image must be less than or equal to the mask image (on a pixel by pixel basis).


  Geodesic morphology is described in Chapter 6.2 of Pierre Soille's book "Morphological Image Analysis: Principles and Applications",
  Second Edition, Springer, 2003.


  Algorithm implemented in this filter is based on algorithm described by Kevin Robinson and Paul F. Whelan in "Efficient
  Morphological
   Reconstruction: A Downhill Filter", Pattern Recognition Letters, Volume 25, Issue 15, November 2004, Pages 1759-1767.

  The algorithm, a description of the transform and some applications can be found in "Morphological Grayscale Reconstruction
  in Image Analysis:
   Applications and Efficient Algorithms", Luc Vincent, IEEE Transactions on image processing, Vol. 2, April 1993.
