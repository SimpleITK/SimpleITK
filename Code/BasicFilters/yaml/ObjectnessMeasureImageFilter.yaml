briefdescription: Enhance M-dimensional objects in N-dimensional images.
detaileddescription: >-
  This filter is a generalization of Frangi's vesselness measurement for detecting M-dimensional object in N-dimensional space.
  For example a vessel is a 1-D object in 3-D space. The filter can enhance blob-like structures (M=0), vessel-like structures
  (M=1), 2D plate-like structures (M=2), hyper-plate-like structures (M=3) in N-dimensional images, with M<N.


  This filter takes a scalar image as input and produces a real valued image as output which contains the objectness measure
  at each pixel. Internally, it computes a Hessian via discrete central differences. Before applying this filter it is expected
  that a Gaussian smoothing filter at an appropriate scale (sigma) was applied to the input image.


  The enhancement is based on the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. For the Frangi's vesselness case were M=1 and N=3 we
  have the 3 eigenvalues such that \f$ | \lambda_1 | < | \lambda_2 | < |\lambda_3 | \f$ . The formula follows:

   \f[ R_A = \frac{|\lambda_2|}{|\lambda_3|}, \; R_B = \frac{|\lambda_2|}{|\lambda_2\lambda_3|}, \; S = \sqrt{\lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2+\lambda_3^2}
  \f] \f[ V_{\sigma}= \begin{cases} (1-e^{-\frac{R_A^2}{2\alpha^2}}) \cdot e^{\frac{R_B^2}{2\beta^2}} \cdot (1-e^{-\frac{S^2}{2\gamma^2}})
  & \text{if } \lambda_2<0 \text{ and } \lambda_3<0 \text{,}\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \f]
