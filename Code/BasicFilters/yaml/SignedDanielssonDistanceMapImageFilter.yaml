    Set if the inside represents positive values in the signed distance map. By convention ON pixels are treated as inside
    pixels.

  detaileddescriptionGet: >-
    Get if the inside represents positive values in the signed distance map. See GetInsideIsPositive()

    Set if the distance should be squared.
  briefdescriptionGet: ''
  detaileddescriptionGet: >-
    Get the distance squared.

  default: 'false'
  briefdescriptionSet: ''
  detaileddescriptionSet: >-
    Set if image spacing should be used in computing distances.
  briefdescriptionGet: ''

    Get Voronoi Map This map shows for each pixel what object is closest to it. Each object should be labeled by a number
    (larger than 0), so the map has a value for each pixel corresponding to the label of the closest object.

briefdescription: This filter computes the signed distance map of the input image as an approximation with pixel accuracy
  to the Euclidean distance.
detaileddescription: >-
  This class is parameterized over the type of the input image and the type of the output image.


  For purposes of evaluating the signed distance map, the input is assumed to be binary composed of pixels with value 0 and
  non-zero.


  The inside is considered as having negative distances. Outside is treated as having positive distances. To change the convention,
  use the InsideIsPositive(bool) function.


  As a convention, the distance is evaluated from the boundary of the ON pixels.


  The filter returns


  \li A signed distance map with the approximation to the euclidean distance.


  \li A voronoi partition. (See itkDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter)


  \li A vector map containing the component of the vector relating the current pixel with the closest point of the closest
  object to this pixel. Given that the components of the distance are computed in "pixels", the vector is represented by an
  itk::Offset . That is, physical coordinates are not used. (See itkDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter)





  This filter internally uses the DanielssonDistanceMap filter. This filter is N-dimensional.
